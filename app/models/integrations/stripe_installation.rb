    # consider using transactions here. if an error occurs in the processing of a webhook, it's not like user-facing
    # errors on the web where they see a red screen of death. instead, sidekiq will reattempt the processing of the
    # entire webhook, which means that earlier portions of your logic will be run more than once unless you're careful
    # to avoid it.
