  # are a bunch of Super Scaffolding hooks here by default to try and help keep generated code logically organized.

  # ðŸš… add concerns above.

  # ðŸš… add belongs_to associations above.

  # ðŸš… add has_many associations above.

  # ðŸš… add oauth providers above.

  # ðŸš… add has_one associations above.

  # ðŸš… add scopes above.

  # ðŸš… add validations above.

  # ðŸš… add callbacks above.

  # ðŸš… add delegations above.

  # ðŸš… add methods above.

  # ðŸš« DEFAULT BULLET TRAIN TEAM FUNCTIONALITY
  # We put these at the bottom of this file to keep them out of the way. You should define your own methods above here.
