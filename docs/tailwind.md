## Link Styles
 - TODO Because the default link style in Bullet Train is `no-underline hover:underline`, we end up defining some alternative link styles inline in certain cases. For example, in `app/views/account/memberships/_index.html.erb` we have a `link_to` that encapsulates not just the name of the `Membership`, but also the profile photo and a label indicating whether it's an outstanding invitation. This requires a little finesse to make work properly, otherwise the label also inherits the underline on hover (which is not desirable). Unfortunately, when we implement this exception inline, we've effectively de-centralized the design decision about default line styles. If you want to later change the default link style in your Bullet Train application, these exceptions will continue to inherit aspects of the former styling. The long term solution here is to introduce some additional utilities for applying a global styling to the block-link use case, but we haven't done this yet.
