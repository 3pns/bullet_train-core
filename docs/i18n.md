# Translations and Internationalization

Bullet Train and views generated by Super Scaffolding are localized by default, meaning all of the human-readable text in your application has been extracted into a YAML configuration file in `config/locales/en` and can be translated into any language you would like to target.

## Dealing with Indirection

Localizing views introducts a layer of indirection, so it's important that we provide tools that make it easy to figure out where a translation you're looking at in your application is coming from, and tools that make it easy to customize anything you need to.

### Show Translation Keys

You can see the full I18N translation key of any string on the page by adding `?show_locales=true` to the URL.

### Log Translation Keys

You can log to the console the full I18N translation key of all strings looked up during a request by adding `?log_locales=true` to the URL. This makes it easier to copy and paste translation keys for strings that rendered in unselectable UI elements in the browser.

### Looking Up Translation Sources

Once you have the full I18N translation key, you can figure out which file it's coming from and, if needed, eject it from the framework for customization in your local application:

```
$ bin/resolve en.account.onboarding.user_details.edit.header --eject --open
```
