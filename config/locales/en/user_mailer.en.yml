          <p>It was important to us that Bullet Train applications have a good looking, branded email template by default.</p>
          <p>Thankfully our friends at <a href="https://postmarkapp.com">Postmark</a> made the foundation of this email template <a href="https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-templates">freely available</a>. From there, we've customized it slightly to better match the default Bullet Train look-and-feel.</p>
